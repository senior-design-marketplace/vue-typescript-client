              <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
              <br />
              <div class="text-start">
                For students and advisors who currently lack a centralized application to organize
                senior design projects, Marqetplace is a decentralized cloud-native application
                suite that acts as a drop-in solution for organizations that allow users to submit,
                join and keep up with the projects in which they are interested.
              </div>
              <br />
              <div class="text-start">
                Unlike the current senior design organization system, which varies by department and
                is not transparent for students, our product is fully available for all participants
                so that students can learn and inquire about projects across disciplines and engage
                more fully with other groups throughout the year.
              </div>
              <br />
              <h2>Project Scope</h2>
              <br />
              <div class="text-start">
                The current team formation process frequently causes delays to the Senior Design
                schedule due to conflicting practices between departments, manual reorganization in
                each section, and lack of early communication with students. These delays and the
                interdepartmental lack of communication result in rushed team formation on behalf of
                advisors and lack of complete project choice for students. The Marqetplace team aims
                to build a platform for users, including students and advisors, to facilitate the
                project selection process. This web technology will act as a drop-in solution to
                allow students and advisors to keep up with the projects they are interested in.
                They will be able to submit and join projects as well as update viewers on project
                progress. Future versions of this platform will include the ability to fully
                integrate with Canvas for further automation, so that advisors can make a change in
                one system that will translate into the other. Unfortunately, that integration does
                not currently fit into the 2019-2020 timeline of this project.

              <h2>Project Description</h2>
              <br />
              <div class="text-start">
                Currently, there is no centralized, organized system for finding and selecting a
                senior design project for Stevens Institute of Technology and other universities.
                Students and advisors must collaborate through unorganized means, meaning that
                interdisciplinary teams are difficult to form. We are building a platform for users,
                including students and advisors, to facilitate the project selection process. This
                web technology will act as a drop-in solution to allow students and advisors to keep
                up with the projects they are interested in. They will be able to submit and join
                projects as well as update viewers on project progress.

              <br />
              <div class="text-start">
                Marqetplace is designed to help students and advisors of colleges who want a more
                reliable and robust senior year experience by creating an online hub for organizing
                and interacting with senior design teams and projects. Our platform will assist team
                formation and project visibility, leading to increased student engagement across
                disciplines and a single, streamlined team formation process for advisors.
