            <h2>Mission Statement</h2> <br>
            <div class="text-start">
              For students and advisors who currently lack a centralized application to organize
              senior design projects, Marqetplace is a decentralized cloud-native application
              suite that acts as a drop-in solution for organizations that allow users to submit,
              join and keep up with the projects in which they are interested.
            </div> <br>
            <div class="text-start">
              Unlike the current senior design organization system, which varies by department and
              is not transparent for students, our product is fully available for all participants
              so that students can learn and inquire about projects across disciplines and engage
              more fully with other groups throughout the year.
            </div> <br>
            <h2>Project Scope</h2> <br>
            <div class="text-start">
              The current team formation process frequently causes delays to the Senior Design
              schedule due to conflicting practices between departments, manual reorganization in
              each section, and lack of early communication with students. These delays and the
              interdepartmental lack of communication result in rushed team formation on behalf of
              advisors and lack of complete project choice for students. The Marqetplace team aims
              to build a platform for users, including students and advisors, to facilitate the
              project selection process. This web technology will act as a drop-in solution to
              allow students and advisors to keep up with the projects they are interested in.
              They will be able to submit and join projects as well as update viewers on project
              progress. Future versions of this platform will include the ability to fully
              integrate with Canvas for further automation, so that advisors can make a change in
              one system that will translate into the other. Unfortunately, that integration does
              not currently fit into the 2019-2020 timeline of this project.

            <h2>Project Description</h2> <br>
            <div class="text-start">
              Currently, there is no centralized, organized system for finding and selecting a
              senior design project for Stevens Institute of Technology and other universities.
              Students and advisors must collaborate through unorganized means, meaning that
              interdisciplinary teams are difficult to form. We are building a platform for users,
              including students and advisors, to facilitate the project selection process. This
              web technology will act as a drop-in solution to allow students and advisors to keep
              up with the projects they are interested in. They will be able to submit and join
              projects as well as update viewers on project progress.

            <h2>Objective</h2> <br>
            <div class="text-start">
              Marqetplace is designed to help students and advisors of colleges who want a more
              reliable and robust senior year experience by creating an online hub for organizing
              and interacting with senior design teams and projects. Our platform will assist team
              formation and project visibility, leading to increased student engagement across
              disciplines and a single, streamlined team formation process for advisors.
